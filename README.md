# Z One-time Login Link
> Allow users to login once without a password


**Project page**

See https://plugins.zodan.nl/

## What does it do?

In projects, we often encounter (groups of) users struggling with the sheer number of passwords they have to manage. Naturally, we support good password management - combined with other, additional security layers. However, we'd like to accommodate this group.

This plugin allows you to log in *securely* without a password.

* In the user list, the plugin creates a ‘Send login once link’ for each user.
* The link creates a personal key linked to the user that can be used to log in temporarily (maximum 15 minutes).
* The link will be sent to the user via email.

Furthermore, the website administrator can customize the settings for
* The link expiration time
* Whether or not users can request a link themselves and if,
* If rate limiting is needed (e.g. no more than once every 5 minutes)


## What needs to be done?

We currently have on our roadmap:
* Adding bulk actions, in order to send (a selection of) users their One-time Login Link in one fell swoop.
* Adding translations

This plugin is under active development.
